  <sub>RLark — Cross-Cluster Embodied Intelligence Cloud-Native Platform</sub>
</h1>

Manage cross-cluster embodied intelligence workloads through a unified cloud-native platform spanning cloud GPU training, cross-cluster collaboration, and edge device deployment across heterogeneous resources such as GPU clusters, robot arms, sensors, and cameras.

> **Explore the complete documentation on [Read the Docs](https://rlark.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)** — start with the [Quick Start](https://rlark.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart/), then continue with the [platform user guide](https://rlark.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/) or [administrator guide](https://rlark.readthedocs.io/en/latest/admin-guide/).

## What's NEW!

- [2026/09] RLark is now open-source.

## Key Capabilities

- **Embodied AI Workload Orchestration**: From cloud GPU training (RL/LLM) to edge deployment (robot arm, sensor, camera), unified declarative Job/Task abstraction across the full pipeline
- **Multi-Runtime Data Plane**: Kubernetes provides unified management for cloud GPU clusters and edge devices across the complete training-to-deployment lifecycle; Docker and Raw runtime support will extend coverage to lightweight edge scenarios where Kubernetes is not suitable
- **Cross-Cluster Resource Abstraction**: Unify multi-site GPU clusters and edge devices via Domain (virtual network domain) and Node (compute node) CRDs, with the control plane running on kcp
- **Declarative Training Jobs**: Job/Task abstraction with declarative distributed training and Ray cluster definition
- **Cross-Cluster Pod Networking**: Virtual network based on TUN devices + gVisor netstack + SSH tunnels, enabling Pod-to-Pod communication without NAT traversal — cloud GPUs and edge robots communicate directly
- **Certificate System**: Dual-layer X.509 + SSH certificates for Agent access, Domain-scoped cross-cluster forwarding authentication, and user SSH authentication
- **Observability**: Prometheus metrics, real-time Pod log streaming, and web management UI

## Roadmap

### Available Today

- Kubernetes-based management of cloud GPU clusters and edge devices
- Declarative Job/Task orchestration for distributed training and Ray workloads
- Cross-cluster resource management through Domain and Node CRDs
- Cross-cluster Pod networking over TUN devices, gVisor netstack, and SSH tunnels
- X.509 and SSH certificate-based authentication
- Prometheus metrics, real-time Pod logs, and a web management UI

### Planned

- Docker runtime support for lightweight data planes
- Raw runtime support for hosts and edge devices without a container orchestrator
- More complete account, role, and permission management
- Continued web UI usability and workflow improvements
- Cross-cluster network throughput, latency, and resource-efficiency optimizations

## Architecture Overview

![System Architecture](apps/rlark/docs/images/architecture.png)

## Quick Start

Follow the [Quick Start Guide on Read the Docs](https://rlark.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart/) to choose one of the verified flows:

- **One-click CLI**: deploy the control plane and two kind data-plane clusters, then verify cross-cluster Pod networking.
- **UI-based flow**: create clusters and a Domain in the web console, deploy two kind data planes, schedule a Job across them, and verify connectivity.
